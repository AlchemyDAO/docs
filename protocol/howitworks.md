# How It Works

Alchemy lets users take any NFTs that meet the ERC721 standard \(almost all\) and create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization which owns the underlying NFT\(s\). 

The DAO is controlled by the DAOâ€™s governance tokens, able to be freely traded and transferred, creating liquid markets for ownership. All tokens are worth 1 vote each, and so owning a token gives you both governance rights letting you vote on what to do with the NFTs and claim rights for NFT sales.
