**Team Multisig**

2,000,000

* 1,000,000 Founder and team allocation
* 400,000 Strategic Investors and partners - will be moved to a decentralized VC model later

**Creator Airdrop**

100,000

Airdrop to users that hold NFTs. These users are able to take a claim for the governance for the protocol and distribute it to the core market that Alchemy will generate revenue from.
