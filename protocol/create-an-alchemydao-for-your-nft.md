# Create an AlchemyDAO for your NFT

AlchemyDAO lets you set up your own DAO for a NFT with just 3 transactions.

You simply supply the following information:

* Token Name
* Token Symbol
* Total Supply
* The address and ID of the NFT you want to make a liquid market of
* The initial buyout price of the DAO in ETH

After that, the AlchemyDAO will generate your very own Alchemy contract and will send the total supply of the token in the form of ERC20 tokens to your wallet.

In the next step, you will have to approve the NFT to the DAO contract and also choose a voting period and a time lock period for your governance contracts.

Once this information is present 2 new contracts will be generated for you: a Time Lock Contract and a Governance Contract.

 Now you are all set, and you can start to distribute your governance token.

A fully initialized DAO has the option to raise funds to buy more NFTs, issue shares for sale, and many more.
