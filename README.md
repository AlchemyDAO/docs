# Introduction

Alchemy is a project designed to completely change the way we think about non-fungible asset ownership. By creating ERC20 GovernorAlpha based DAOs that wrap any NFTs into fungible and liquid tokens, Alchemy allows people to sell partial ownership, create collectives for collections and turn illiquid assets into liquid ones.
