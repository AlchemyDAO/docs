# Token Distribution

The ALCH supply will be 10,000,000 with the following allocations

**Team Multisig**

2,000,000

* 1,000,000 Founder and team allocation
* 400,000 Strategic Investors and partners - will be moved to a decentralized VC model later
* 200,000 Growth and Community
* 400,000 future devs, team, and advisors

**Creator Airdrop**

500,000

Airdrop to early users that create NFT DAOs for their NFTs. These users are the base for the ecosystem and need to pay the costs to deploy the contracts as well as be willing to decentralize their ownership.

**Community Airdrop**

1,000,000

Airdrop to users that hold NFTs. These users are able to take a claim for the governance for the protocol and distribute it to the core market that Alchemy will generate revenue from.

**Liquidity Providers**

500,000

A small allocation to ALCH/ETH LP stakers to allow for liquidity using a perpetual drip-based system after a 2w bootstrap period.

**Treasury**

5,000,000

* 2,000,000 after launch once the team doesnt have majority control for the DAO
* 3,000,000 slowly vested for 2y to allow for continuous cash flow for early growth
