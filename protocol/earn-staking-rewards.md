# Earn Staking Rewards

Every buyout that happens for an NFT that was owned by an Alchemy-based NFT DAO sends a small fee to the ALCH DAO which splits the fee between the ALCH Treasury and a staking contract. ALCH holders can stake ALCH tokens to earn these fees, which as the usage for Alchemy DAOs grows so will these fees.

ALCH also controls the Alchemy Treasury, where holders can vote on how the funds should be used to manage and grow the protocol. By allowing for holders to vote as well as have a direct interest in the growth that drives fee revenue, the system incentivizes the best possible uses for funds that will benefit the protocol and the holders symbiotically.
